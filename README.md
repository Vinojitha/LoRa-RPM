**Design and Implementation of a LoRA WAN Network in Healthcare: Empowering Patient Monitoring with a Cloud IoT Platform**

**Abstract**

This project aims to design and implement a LoRA WAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) in healthcare to enhance patient monitoring capabilities using a Cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The LoRA WAN technology allows for long-range and low-power communication (Jonathan de Carvalho Silva, 2017), making it ideal for connecting medical devices and sensors across healthcare facilities. Leveraging the Cloud IoT platform enables efficient data connectivity, real-time monitoring, and data analysis, leading to improved patient care and remote healthcare management. Integrating LoRA WAN and the Cloud IoT platform provides a scalable and secure solution for healthcare providers to monitor patients effectively and make informed decisions based on real-time data. This project aims to contribute to advancing patient care in the healthcare sector through enhanced connectivity and data-driven insights.
